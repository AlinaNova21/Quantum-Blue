  # Rule A3: Rules regarding sharing in-round information
Quantum Blue welcomes content creators and streamers to our community, but we have a few rules regarding livestreaming game servers.
  - While a stream delay is not necessary, it is highly recommended to have at least a 10 second delay.
  - Please let admins know you are streaming via the AHelp prior to doing so.
  - If your chat or viewers are in-game with you while also watching your stream, they are breaking our server rules.
  - Please do not coordinate with them and discourage this behavior if it is seen.
  - Streaming to places such as Discord is allowed, as long as your viewers are not in the same round.

Regarding text channels in external applications or use of LOOC, or otherwise voice communications through external means:
  - Similar rules still apply: Sharing explicit information about a round with people who are in it is forbidden.
  - Using LOOC to share in-round information is also explicitly forbidden and WILL have repercussions. For example, being converted by a Cosmic Cultist and using LOOC to say "I knew it was cosmic cult".
