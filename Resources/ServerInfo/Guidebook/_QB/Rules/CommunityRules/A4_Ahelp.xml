  # Rule A4: Engage in proper AHelp etiquette.
  The Ahelp (F1) chat is for contacting admins. We are a small server with a small staff, so please be patient if we can't respond right away.
  - Intentionally disconnecting, responding with hostility, or refusing to respond when an admin privately messages you in-game may be met with a ban.
  - Additionally, abusing the AHelp relay by flooding it with garbage similarly may result in a ban.
  - All AHelp messages are relayed to the Quantum Blue Discord. Just because your AHelp was not answered does not mean we cannot see it. If your problem isn't resolved in a round please feel free to contact an admin directly via our Discord.
