  # Rule C1: Command, Security and Justice Guidelines
While admins may have more leniency with other roles, Command, Security and Justice are almost like "Dungeon Masters" in Space Station 14, you get to influence the round's flow, pacing and everybody's enjoyment of it a lot more than other roles, so make sure to act accordingly.
  - Your character has a mindshield and must act like such, with unquestioned loyalty to Nanotrasen.
    - Your character is presumed to be sane, competent in their duties, and able to make decisions to the benefit of the station.
    - Giving away Traitor objective items and sensitive equipment should be avoided in these roles. Your character should value them deeply.
      - Leeway is given to making deals with criminals if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the crew and station OR if the deal involves items of a primarily sentimental value (e.g. HoP's Ian scrapbook, LO's lucky dollar).
      - Leeway can be given in [color=#ff0000]extreme circumstances[/color] of emergency/crisis.
  - The three departments are required to read and follow Quantum Blue Space Law, Standard Operating Procedure and Alert Procedure with good intent. Circumstances may appear where violating these documents is accidental or unavoidable, this is appropriate as long as they are making an effort to roleplay and follow the documents to the best of their known ability.
    - [color=#ff0000]Circumstances and context may permit you to break these laws. However, the fact that this rule is malleable is not an excuse to ignore it entirely.[/color]
    - Your character is expected to uphold the law and maintain order aboard the station. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior, and ensure all laws are followed whenever possible.
    - Security is expected to intervene in criminal activity where possible and safe to do so.
    - Heads of departments are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to Security and should cooperate with law enforcement where possible.
  - Do not hire random crew to be your bodyguard(s) or promote random crewmembers to Command positions at random. If you require bodyguards or security details, talk to your Security department. If you need new Command staff, talk to the personnel in that related department.
  - If you need to leave the round, notify your fellow crew via departmental radio and put your equipment in its proper places prior to going to cryo.
