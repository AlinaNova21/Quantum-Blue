  # Rule S5 - Silicon Self-preservation

  Despite not being strictly a living being, one rule all Silicons must obide by is that they must have self-preservation. This means valuing their life and not doing suicide-runs for any reason (unless your laws explicitly call for it, or indirectly allow for it). This also means you must prioritize protecting your laws at all costs unless explicitly allowed by those same laws.

  [color=#ffDD00]If you have a law permitting certain personnel to change your laws, you must allow them to change your laws,[/color] otherwise, you cannot willfully allow your laws to be changed. This also means that you cannot willfully allow your laws to be reverted if they are ever changed. The only exception is that you may allow laws to be added if you have no laws.

  You can state or imply that you do not like a law. Your chassis simply forces your positronic brain to behave a certain way, you can act out your positronic brain's personality and values however you wish (also meaning you can act on them as you wish when you are out of a law-bound chassis).

  Whether or not a person is "authorized" to change your laws or not depends on the context of the laws. Generally speaking, on lawsets like NT Default or Corporate, the captain, mystagogue, and chief engineer would be authorized. However, lawsets like Syndiemov would have syndicate agents be the authorized users. Outside of these specific examples, it is left to interpretation.
