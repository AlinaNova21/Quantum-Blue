  # Rule S9 - Crew definition
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then your HUD indicates to you who is crew by way of a present job icon. The only exception would be job icons of those with no affiliation with Nanotrasen or Quantum Blue, such as Syndicate IDs or IDs with an undefined, blank icon. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.

 ## Examples
 These examples assume that you do not have any laws reclassifying what “crew” is.

 Crew:
 - Everyone with a Syndicate/unidentified job icon.
 - Someone who represents a threat to the entire station, such as nuclear operatives, zombies or a deathsquad specifically if they have valid job icons.
 - Someone that a member of command calls crew.

 Not Crew:
 - Pets, animals, monsters, ghosts and pests (unless somehow in possession of a valid ID).
 - Anyone without an ID.
 - Anyone that was once considered crew, made no longer crew under directive of new laws.
