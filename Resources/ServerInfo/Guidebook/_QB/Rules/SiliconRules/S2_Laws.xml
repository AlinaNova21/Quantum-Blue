# Rule S2 - Your silicon laws are rules
  Silicon players are given a list of active laws. Each of these laws is effectively a roleplay rule that the character must follow. The primary differences between laws and actual rules are that lawyering of laws is much more tolerated than lawyering of rules, and that silicon laws are more dynamic than rules. Silicon laws can change during a round, and different characters can have different laws, whereas everyone always shares the same set of rules.

  Lawyering refers to finding and exploiting loopholes, which are unintended but reasonable interpretations. The rules are written to attempt to communicate an intention, but silicon laws are written with the intention that loopholes be exploitable.

  Keep in mind however that trying to lawyer your lawset into an excuse for going haywire is explicitly not allowed. Your interpretation should still follow English language definitions (for example, a Station AI twisting the laws of the Paladin lawset to interpret "fairness" as "equality", a completely different meaning, to allow crew access into the entire station is not only lame, but explicitly forbidden AND lame). General rule of thumb is: Don't be lame about it.
