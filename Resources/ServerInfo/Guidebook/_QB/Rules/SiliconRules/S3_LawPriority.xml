  # Rule S3 - Laws must be prioritized
  Most laws will be numbered, with higher number laws appearing last. Laws with a lower number take priority over laws with larger numbers.

  Occasionally you may have laws which have some scrambled text instead of a number and appear in front of other laws, these take priority over all other laws. If you have multiple laws like this, the order that they are listed in determines their priority: laws listed first are prioritized over other laws.

  ## Examples
  - Law 1 says to not kill any crew. Law 2 says to kill all chefs. You cannot kill any chefs that are crew, but must kill any that are not crew.
  - Law 0 says to obey any orders given to you by the Station AI. Law 1 tells you that there are a billion evil robots on station. If they AI tells you there are no evil robots that is what you must believe in.
