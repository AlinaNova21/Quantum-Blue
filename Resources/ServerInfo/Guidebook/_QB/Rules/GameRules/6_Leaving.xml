  # Rule B6: Leaving the Game
  - If you wish to leave the game, please use the cryosleep chambers located in/near the dorms when possible. This will free up your character's job to be filled by a new player.
  - AFK (a.k.a. SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as any other crewmate.
    - If a player is dead and catatonic (not SSD), they are not required to be revived and should be stored in the morgue. You should not biomass and/or grind dead and catatonic crew unless in an emergency.
    - If a player is alive and catatonic, they may be brought to cryostorage as necessary, after confirming they have not been present for 20 minutes.
    - If you are readied up for a role with only one slot you are still allowed to leave the round early, but repeatedly taking up those roles and leaving the game early may result in a temporary if not permanent role ban.
    - Before cryoing or taking somebody else to cryo, make sure you return any irreplaceable or unique items when appropriate, such as any item unique to your loadout/locker, a pin-pointer, antagonist steal objectives, or anything of the sort.
    - Readying up and cryoing immediately upon not receiving an antagonist role is explicitly against the rules and can get you banned.
