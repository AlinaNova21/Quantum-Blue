 # Rule B4: Powergaming Guidelines
"Powergaming" is considered to be the act of prioritizing "winning" rather than sensible roleplaying. We are here to play characters, not to look for a "you win" screen. Being vulnerable and accepting the loss of your character for the sake of everybody's fun is important.
  - Try to engage with players if they are attempting to roleplay an antagonistic scene. Example: if there is a hostage situation, do not immediately shoot them mid sentence.
    - Leeway is given depending on the context. Nuclear Operatives trying to hold a negotiation without proper de-escalation, and an antagonist trying to negotiate with you after already screwing you over gives you, specifically, the right to do the same back to them.
  - Do not, [color=#ff0000]under any circumstances[/color], hide the nuclear fission explosive, or other sensitive items in an impossible to see/access location. This is excessively lame.
  - [color=#ff0000]Non-security personnel should not seek to kill or detain threats on most situations.[/color] You should generally attempt to flee from combat or dangerous situations. Remember that your character likely fears injury or death. However, if fleeing is not an option and/or all of security is dead you may choose to engage against major antagonists.
    - Remember that trying to fight antagonists while security is still around and actively working can sometimes only make things worse. This can be considered self-antagging regardless of your intentions.
  - [color=#ff0000]If there is sufficient roleplay, reason, and rationale, you may be exempt from this rule. Always ask an administrator in round before conducting such an action and follow the rules on escalation.[/color]
