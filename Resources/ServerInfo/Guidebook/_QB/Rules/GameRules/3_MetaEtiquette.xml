  # Rule B3: Follow the meta etiquette.
  - Just because something isn't Metashielded doesn't mean you should feel compelled to use that edge against somebody. Remember that your priority should be roleplaying, not winning.
  - Think about Metashielded information as "earned". Just because you're allowed to figure something out by technicality in that moment doesn't necessarily mean you should. Your fun should come from playing it out as your character in that situaton, not as yourself strictly kiting around the rules.
  - These aren't as hard-set rules so leeway is granted, but repeated warnings will result in escalating punishments. This rule is to keep people from playing around the rules and not the roleplay, afterall.
